Architecture
===========

This document provides an overview of the ComicDB architecture and design decisions.

High-Level Architecture

   graph TD
       A[User Interface] <--> B[Application Layer]
       B <--> C[Business Logic]
       C <--> D[Data Access Layer]
       D <--> E[Database/Storage]

Core Components
--------------

1. **User Interface**
   - Built with Tkinter
   - Follows MVC pattern
   - Responsive design

2. **Application Layer**
   - Handles user input
   - Manages application state
   - Coordinates between UI and business logic

3. **Business Logic**
   - Comic metadata processing
   - File operations
   - Library management

4. **Data Access**
   - SQLite database
   - File system operations
   - Caching layer

Data Flow

       participant UI as UI Layer
       participant BL as Business Logic
       participant DAL as Data Access
       
       U->>UI: Performs Action
       UI->>BL: Process Request
       BL->>DAL: Get/Update Data
       DAL-->>BL: Return Data
       BL-->>UI: Update View
       UI-->>U: Show Result

Key Design Patterns
------------------

1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
   - Separates UI from business logic
   - Makes the code more maintainable

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data access
   - Makes it easy to switch storage backends

3. **Observer Pattern**
   - Used for event handling
   - Enables loose coupling between components

Performance Considerations
------------------------

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Comic pages are loaded on demand
   - Metadata is cached

2. **Database Indexing**
   - Properly indexed for common queries
   - Query optimization for large libraries

3. **Memory Management**
   - Large files are streamed
   - Proper cleanup of resources

Security
--------

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user input is validated
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities

2. **File Operations**
   - Safe file handling
   - Permission checks

3. **Data Privacy**
   - User data is stored securely
   - Optional encryption for sensitive data

Future Considerations
--------------------

1. Plugin system for extending functionality
2. Cloud sync capabilities
3. Mobile app with shared backend
