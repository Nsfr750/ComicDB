## Centralized Logging System

All log entries (info, warning, error, and uncaught exceptions) are written to `traceback.log` in your project root. The logging system is thread-safe and timestamps all entries.

### How to Use

```python
from struttura.logger import log_info, log_warning, log_error

log_info("A message for info level")
log_warning("A message for warning level")
log_error("A message for error level")
```

To automatically log uncaught exceptions, call:

```python
from struttura.logger import setup_global_exception_logging
setup_global_exception_logging()
```

### Log Viewer

Access the Log Viewer from the menu bar to filter logs in real time by ALL, INFO, WARNING, or ERROR.

### Automated Tests

Automated tests for the logging system are provided in `tests/test_logger.py`. These tests verify info, warning, error, and exception logging, as well as global exception hook functionality.

Run tests with:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\pytest tests/test_logger.py
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py` ‚Äî Main entry point
- `gui/` ‚Äî GUI components (windows, widgets)
- `struttura/` ‚Äî Core logic, dialogs, and utilities

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` for a module in `struttura`, make sure you are running from the root and not from inside a subfolder.
- All sibling imports in `struttura` use relative imports (e.g., `from .about import About`).
